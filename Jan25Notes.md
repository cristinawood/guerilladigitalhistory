# Notes

## Aesthetic Shock
- still operating on a broadcast model in public history, thinking on a broadcast model
- inverting it with digital data, targeting it 
- confounding people, making them uncomfortable with the history of their homes
- stickers question?
  - microhistories 
- projecting a text and virtual bricks flying in, words exploding apart
- we feel very tied to text 
- breaking our own connection with text? Is that going to be poetic terrorism?

## Anonymity
- But, what about anonymity? Isn't it good to be anonymous? Good to have an author?
  - there is also a safety aspect to it...
  - as a viewer, implications that come with anonymity. Feeling that it will be activist, connotation that goes with it. Automatically there! 
  - people want to know where information is coming from! 
  - Truth decay - believing wacky things that confirm biases etc. 
  - Company: *livefire* and saying everything they want, videos now too. 4Chan and Reddit movements. Attack on ideas and the truth coming up. 
 - What gravitas exists behind names, university, etc.! There is a coordinated attack on truth right now! Do we as historians, as digital historians want to be doing things that undermine those things? To be confronted with truth. 
- What are the implications here? Where do I draw the line?
- We protect ourselves in different ways too. How do we do that? Where are our lines?
- Content has to do with this too:
  - Projecting the names of people from 60s scoop on church? Not okay! 
  - Does the public have to be involved in the intervention?
  - Actors/vulnerable people definitely do! 

## Aris
- Same questions in a new technology might look really different. Have different answers! 
- making sure your content is able to load up really fast! 
- have to get into the game! 
- alternate reality games: http://activehistory.ca/2012/05/tecumseh-lies-here/, http://www.ilovebees.co/.
- What did we find? 
  - Phone is your tardis
  - affordances: big variety in terms of what you can offer ie. interactive conversation, 3D conversation! 
- First thing after making a new game is to make a scene. 1 scene for all of the game, think of it like a giant container! 
- Plaques are the way-points in your story, or locations where things might happen. To add those to your game, go under scene and hit plus button. 
- Available anywhere button means people can click the thing from anywhere. Unclicking it means you can drop it in a point on the map. 
- Can make zones of interaction much bigger!
- Show map title means you could see on it on the map! 
- To add media: Hit Media, upload files/images. 
- Locks: these are conditional! Items to be collected, viewed a plaque, visited a webnotes, notes with tag, etc. 
- Quests: can be locked, won't appear until he's got one Florin, player has a conversation with Fritz and the cow. How to add the quest, add to your scene. 
- conversations: could have several that interlink! add web page under same place as scenes.
