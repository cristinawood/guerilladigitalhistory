# Notes

## Aesthetic Shock
- still operating on a broadcast model in public history, thinking on a broadcast model
- inverting it with digital data, targeting it 
- confounding people, making them uncomfortable with the history of their homes
- stickers question?
  - microhistories 
- projecting a text and virtual bricks flying in, words exploding apart
- we feel very tied to text 
- breaking our own connection with text? Is that going to be poetic terrorism?

## Anonymity
- But, what about anonymity? Isn't it good to be anonymous? Good to have an author?
  - there is also a safety aspect to it...
  - as a viewer, implications that come with anonymity. Feeling that it will be activist, connotation that goes with it. Automatically there! 
  - people want to know where information is coming from! 
  - Truth decay - believing wacky things that confirm biases etc. 
  - Company: *livefire* and saying everything they want, videos now too. 4Chan and Reddit movements. Attack on ideas and the truth coming up. 
 - What gravitas exists behind names, university, etc.! There is a coordinated attack on truth right now! Do we as historians, as digital historians want to be doing things that undermine those things? To be confronted with truth. 
- What are the implications here? Where do I draw the line?
- We protect ourselves in different ways too. How do we do that? Where are our lines?
