# Picturing Lebreton Flats 

## The idea 
I find place histories really compelling, and as we were asked to think about what kind of story we'd like to tell through this project in guerilla digital public history, I thought of Lebreton Flats. Having lived in Ottawa all my life, I've known Lebreton mostly as an "empty" space, eventually as the site of the War Museum, and - as a teen - Bluesfest. When I encountered up Phil Jenkins' ***An Acre of Time*** in high school, I was enthralled with the history and ****ghosts**** of this place.   re-placing the displaced
