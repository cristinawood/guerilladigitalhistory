# Notes for February 8 

## How does our project here connect with broader work and research?
- autheniticity, control, materiality and control
- Tim Ingold - The Temporality of Landscape 
- completion and finish it, part of the point is not to finight it
- ephemera as well
- mechanical sense of stress can lead to emotional sense
- assemblage theory - assemblage is not just the game editor, it's also the place
- Megan Dennis on ethics (@GingeryGamer) on Twitter
- Megan Smith Artist - interesting stuff with space and place. University of Leeds, wormhole between places and streetscapes 
- mere tool use, means to an end in digital history. Tool changes what you can learn, how you know it. 
- listing: what is it that I've had to know, had to do, in order to do this?
- narrow application of tool use?
- Github is light - can be accessible across the digital divide
