##Projection Mapping: The hardware details

I had the chance to take the show on the road - to the Flats! I had scoped the potential projection sites out a few days before and decided roughly on at least two: the white construction hoarding on Booth Street that covers the LRT station construction, and one of a few electrical boxes at the intersection of Booth Street and the parkway. 

The biggest issue of projecting beyond my living room was finding a power source. While my laptop (with MapMap running) can operate on battery power, the projector still needed a three-prong plug. I kept forgetting about this, thinking I could project anytime, and then realized I wouldn't have access to a wall plug. I thought about trying to hook the projector up to a car for a while but realized it would have to be left running. This would also take away from the "guerilla" nature of this project in a way - I didn't want to disrupt traffic or have a big visual impact besides the projections themselves.

After much googling and many youtube videos, I came across the potential solution presented in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNY9bDuy5r0.
The video makes an outdoor movie theatre with a projector screen and powers the projector using a "power pack." These awesome things come with booster cables and are meant to be useful when you're stranded with a dead car battery and an expired CAA membership card.

They sell for between $120-300 dollars at Canadian Tire or Walmart, and while it might be useful someday, it didn't seem like a sensible purchase yet. I was able to borrow one from a friend and while it didn't have a three-prong plug built in, it had a car cigarette lighter input. I used this converter...

...to hook the projector up to the power pack battery. No need to flip any switches, it just powered away! Because of this, we made sure to unplug the projector right away after using it to prevent draining the battery. Aside from that, I also needed an HDMI converter for my Macbook:

I used this short throw projector borrowed from Shawn, and it works beautifully.

More on how it went later, this was meant as a write-up of the hardware requirements for future and the troubleshooting there.
