# The first devlog

This week in guerrilla digital history has been all about [Poetic Terrorism and Art Sabotage](https://ia800208.us.archive.org/14/items/al_Hakim_Bey_T.A.Z._The_Temporary_Autonomous_Zone_Ontological_Anarchy_Poetic_Terror/Hakim_Bey__T.A.Z.__The_Temporary_Autonomous_Zone__Ontological_Anarchy__Poetic_Terrorism_a4.pdf). 

We did a lot of thinking about aesthetic shock, and what the implications of poetic "terrorism" would be. I was really questioning the ethics of targeted and shocking content, and felt a lot more comfortable with easy, intriguing stories that pull people in without major criticisms. On the other hand though, there is a sense of responsibility to tell a complicated story or counternarrative at play as well. 

Anonymity was another major concern, especially in these times where connections to truth are increasingly tenuous. Shawn raised the point that while there are real dangers in attaching one's name to something controversial, there is a sense that as historians and humanists, confronting publics with truth-telling can be a radical and powerful thing. 

As part of our studio exercise, we worked through [ARIS](https://fielddaylab.org/make/aris/) to create an AR game and play with *in situ* storytelling. I created a simple game dropping cow characters in various places in Ottawa, with different subsequent actions. What follows will hopefully help in future to recreate what I did on ARIS, but there is also lots of valuable help in their excellent video tutorials.

I began creating a scene, which acts as the container for the game. While a complex game might include many scenes, and the possibility to unlock access to further scenes/levels, **Ottawa Cows** started with one.
