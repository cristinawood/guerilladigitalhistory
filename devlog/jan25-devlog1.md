# The first devlog

This week in guerrilla digital history has been all about [Poetic Terrorism and Art Sabotage](https://ia800208.us.archive.org/14/items/al_Hakim_Bey_T.A.Z._The_Temporary_Autonomous_Zone_Ontological_Anarchy_Poetic_Terror/Hakim_Bey__T.A.Z.__The_Temporary_Autonomous_Zone__Ontological_Anarchy__Poetic_Terrorism_a4.pdf). 

We did a lot of thinking about aesthetic shock, and what the implications of poetic "terrorism" would be. I was really questioning the ethics of targeted and shocking content, and felt a lot more comfortable with easy, intriguing stories that pull people in without major criticisms. On the other hand though, there is a sense of responsibility to tell a complicated story or counternarrative at play as well. 

Anonymity was another major concern, especially in these times where connections to truth are increasingly tenuous. Shawn raised the point that while there are real dangers in attaching one's name to something controversial, there is a sense that as historians and humanists, confronting publics with truth-telling can be a radical and powerful thing. 

As part of our studio exercise, we worked through [ARIS](https://fielddaylab.org/make/aris/) to create an AR game and play with *in situ* storytelling. I created a simple game dropping cow characters in various places in Ottawa, with different subsequent actions. What follows will hopefully help in future to recreate what I did on ARIS, but there is also lots of valuable help in their excellent video tutorials.

I began by creating a scene, which acts as the container for the game. While a complex game might include many scenes, and the possibility to unlock access to further scenes/levels, **Ottawa Cows** started with one.

Next, I added plaques, which act as way-points in the story, and these were individual cows, with images as added under Media (see image above) and storytelling elements: ![storytelling elements](guerilladigitalhistory/Screen Shot 2018-02-01 at 11.18.55 AM.png) 

It was super straightforward to add the plaques to the story scene, and then link them to points on the map. These could then be set to be triggered when a player is physically in range, or could be available anywhere. Mine are available anywhere for testing purposes, but if I continued with the game, I'd certainly set them for players to stumble on them. 

I also played around with events, items, and attributes. I set up "CowBucks" as the game's unit of currency, and played with the exchange of CowBucks for an item. 

What this looks like on the phone/device from the user's perspective:

and the inventory:

And from the developer's perspective:

As well, I added the possibility to gain attributes. Though I'm not totally satisfied with the wording and image here (feels a little awkward) it is good to get the idea. The player goes to the Museum of Nature, and acquires "Independent Learning." Eventually, they'd be able to use this for another purpose.

All in all, this exercise was incredibly satisfying, user-friendly, and inspiring for further projects. As my MRP plan had been to map Ottawa's monuments, this platform opened new possibilities for that and for the complex stories that might be told through the "choose-your-own-adventure" format.
