## The fourth devlog

Last week's class was an exciting chance to play with projection mapping and experiment with the technology I'll be using for the Lebreton Flats and Ralph Wallace Burton plan (which still needs an official title). It was really encouraging to play around in MapMap, which was quite easy to install, and know that I could make something happen. 

The next steps with the project will involve the videos from the NFB about Ottawa's "Disadvantaged neighbourhoods" and finding more details on how I might use them and trim them down. 

I'd like to lay them over the paintings to add life to them! How will I bring these theories to the fore though? How will I explain the process? I'd like to come up with a plan for an accompanying site, to showcase some of the background work and research. This is where I'm at this week, but really need to flesh these thoughts out after class.
