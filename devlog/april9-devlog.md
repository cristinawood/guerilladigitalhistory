## Working with MapMap

While I'd already played with MapMap, in the time since then I'd had to erase my hard drive and reformat my computer, obviously uninstalling the app. This meant reinstalling, which was a good opportunity to take notes and keep track of how that all went down in case I need to do the same thing again! This devlog is being written from notes I'd handwritten too. 

I downloaded the program from this page: https://mapmapteam.github.io, as well as installing GStreamer. According to Wikipedia, GStreamer is a "pipeline-based multimedia framework that links together a wide variety of media processing systems to complete complex workflows. For instance, GStreamer can be used to build a system that reads files in one format, processes them, and exports them in another. The formats and processes can be changed in a plug and play fashion."

Originally, I downloaded one of the first versions of MapMap, and it was giving me trouble (because it was basically a beta) and that was frustrating before I realized. Note for later to always look for the latest version and not just download the first thing you see! 

Once MapMap and Gstreamer were installed, I launched MapMap via Terminal so I could see whatever error messages came up. None did, so I could get to work! 

The basic window shows a toolbar, an input editor and an output editor, as well as a sidebar. I began by uploading a media file, essentially whatever you're going to project. This was the .mp4 I made in iMovie in my case.

This becomes a "paint" and needs to become a "mesh" to appear in the editor. Hitting "add mesh" in the toolbar (I chose a basic rectangle, but could have chosen triangle or circle meshes) makes the paint appear in both editor windows. Here's what that looks like:

And a view of the sidebar options, and the output editor on the bottom.

My next step was to see what the output window would look like projected and play with the warping of the mesh in the fullscreen option. In the toolbar, I hit "View > Toggle Fullscreen."

From there, I could also hide or display controls when I was happy with how the projection was customized to fit a space. 
Here's what the fullscreen projection looks like with controls: ![controls in fullscreen](https://img.ziggi.org/cCIth2K5.png)

MapMap was really user-friendly once I got the hang of it, with the only challenge being that sometimes the view gets super-zoomed in. The solution to this is basically to shrink the paint corner-by-corner until you've got something you can work with. I didn't figure out a clear reason why this was happening but it was an easy fix.

From here and from a soft/digital perspective, I was ready to take this show on the road! Will write up the hardware set-up and projections themselves in the next devlog.
