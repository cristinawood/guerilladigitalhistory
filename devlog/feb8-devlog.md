## The third devlog

This week, I've been thinking about making things in DH, and what excites me and scares me about that. I read through Jentery Sayers' essay on UVic's Offpaper [link to Offpaper](http://web.uvic.ca/~jentery/offpaper/) in which he asks "DH friends" why they love to make things. While responses did differ, most expressed interest in how the abstract becomes the concrete, and putting the theory and process of research and work out in the open. I think this really appeals to me, but I'm also drawn to the materiality of making something creative and tangible to tell a story. As far as my thinking about Lebreton Flats and Ralph Wallace Burton's sketches, and combining them with videos/some representation of the people and lives in the area, I am a bit stuck about how to bring the theory and story to the fore. 

Initially, I think: text. There has to be some kind of sub/surtitling on the images or in a projected video loop to explain what's going on to passers-by or an audience. The captions on Craig Winslow's *Light Capsules* project in Winnipeg come to mind as an example of this - [Milady chocolates](https://vimeo.com/228257568). This would be perfectly fine for my purposes, but there might be a more interesting way to do it. 

For example, what about masking the art in a piece of text, and having it transition to the painting itself, thus shifting from the art as background to the art as the story itself? 

Some examples of what I mean (still figuring out how to put images I upload into Markdown files:)
