## Making the videos to project

I had wanted to save a process devlog to record the creation of the videos and that process. This is a writeup of notes that I took by hand as I was working through that. I had a really clear vision of how I wanted the projection to look, and especially an idea of the feeling I wanted them to evoke. 
I wanted an almost ghostly layer of the NFB footage of kids playing in the streets for a few reasons...
- the footage is just ***so*** good. Timeless kid-activities used to showcase "disadvantaged neighbourhoods" (that's what the footage description reads) and it just makes such a powerful statement about the conflict of values in that place in that moment. 
- the footage is black and white, and would be layered on top of the beautiful, bright and vibrant Burton paintings. The contrast would be so cool. 
- the movement of games of tag, kids quickly moving from lying - relatively still - and sunbathing on the street to a frenzied rush to move out of the way as a car approaches, the little girl trundling down a laneway toward beautiful white hanging laundry - all of these moments of movement give such a sense of the childhoods experienced 

The paintings, in contrast with this movement and flux of the footage, are still. They capture winter-scenes, and rarely include people. I chose paintings without people to really demonstrate that contrast. Burton's mission is to preserve the buildings and streets, cars and buses parked, ***this moment in place*** before it's flattened. 

I chose four paintings as a starting point, based on the ones I had access to online. The project may have been changed had the support strike not been on at the time of its creation, as I'd considered paying for the City Archives to scan all the Burton paintings they have, but wasn't sure about being reimbursed for that! I took the footage I could and chose the four most vibrant moments I could find! 

I had access to iMovie on my laptop and decided to work with that. The process was fairly straightforward, but I'm including notes and screenshots for future reference. 

After importing the photos and video clip (which I had screengrabbed from the NFB Archives via Screencastomatic plugin on Google Chrome) to the iMovie project, I could clip the footage and work with it. I figured out that Command + B was a shorter way to cut the clip when I hovered the mouse over the point I wanted, and could work with the footage that way. 

The NFB footage came with time stamp and watermark, and I wanted to make sure I could take that out.

I was able to crop the footage using the crop tool at the top, and could choose several options. The best was "Crop to fill" - it let me choose the best spot to focus in on. I also made sure to undo the "Ken Burns" setting on the paintings as I dropped those into the project, which was starting the image smaller and shifting it as it ended and I wanted that backdrop to stay still.

To create the transparent effect, I had to make sure the NFB footage was on top of the Burton painting base, when it's called a "cutaway."

From there, I could play with the Opacity of the footage until it looked right - there was no consistent number or point, just what worked for the tone of each clip and painting together. It was pretty simple to play with that, though I imagine iMovie will be updated and change in future and it might get more complicated! Just sliding the little toggle back and forth until I found the sweet spot of overlap, playing and replaying to get it right.

One thing I noticed as I played through was that the end of one clip and transition into another was pretty abrupt, so I extended the time that the painting was displayed a bit beyond the footage, and had the footage fade for 2.5 seconds into the painting. This worked visually, and I find also evokes a sense of the expropriation and the life moving away from the area, leaving a still image of buildings behind. 

Once I was happy with the clips and how they were combined, I saved the project in iMovie and exported to an mp4 for use in MapMap. So awesome!
