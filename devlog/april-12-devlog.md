I had wanted to make modal windows work on my Hugo site, built on a single-page site template. I thought modals would be the perfect solution to the impulse to add more details to the site without overloading the basic template. I met with Shawn and Rob, who tried to help me come up with the code to add those into my HTML index file and make them work on the site.
