# The second devlog

Thinking through: "cracks in the system. How has your chosen tech been used in Ottawa? How could it be used? What are its affordances and edges? Where and why do these resonate with the history you wish to tell/explore? What is it that you don't know but need to find out?"

I feel very drawn to the local story of Lebreton Flats, and the 1962 expropriation of the land by the NCC.
