## The fifth devlog

The past week has really been productive in terms of ironing out the technical bits of the Lebreton Flats and Ralph Wallace Burton video and artwork display, but has left me with a few issues to sort out. First, the copyright/permissions issues. I've reached out to the Ottawa archives to see the photographs of RWB's artwork in person and ask what the permissions are. I had originally found the artwork featured on a local history blog with no attribution. I've also inquired with NFB to potentially purchase the video clips of kids playing in the Ottawa neighbourhoods, and whether they might be used for this project. Those two are now waiting problems. 

I've started now to consider the public-facing, public education aspect of the project that will set it apart from being an art installation. I'd love to make the paradata of the project public, and have videos of the projection carry on on a website. In a way, the project has a built-in audience, a group "remembering" the Flats neighbourhoods pre-expropriation through images and videos on Facebook. As a public historian, I'm also considering what responsibility or necessity there is to include or involve those stakeholders either through the website, with a comment or feedback form, or somewhere they might share their stories. At the very least, linking people to the Facebook page/group might be a good bridge between my work and their community.
