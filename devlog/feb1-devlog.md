# The second devlog

Thinking through: "cracks in the system. How has your chosen tech been used in Ottawa? How could it be used? What are its affordances and edges? Where and why do these resonate with the history you wish to tell/explore? What is it that you don't know but need to find out?"

I feel very drawn to the local story of Lebreton Flats, and the 1962 expropriation of the land by the NCC. 

I'd be keen to do projection mapping as a form of resistance to the expropriations and the land contaminations, but in a beautiful, positive way. This perspective especially informed by work I've found online with vicious resistance to and criticism of the NCC, and their motives. 

I came across Ralph Burton, an Ottawa artist who studied under A.Y. Jackson and was inspired by Group of Seven work. He was asked before the demolitions to paint scenes of the flats, and I'd love to do something with these.

What I'd really be keen to do would be to add people, life, video into these, and bring them to life somewhere. Where I'm really stuck is **how** that would work, especially given what's on the land now. 

Some videos from 1948, Ottawa's "disadvantaged neighbourhoods" which include Lebreton Flats: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uoR3TMQY30o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
